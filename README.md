## <div align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I'm Thanisorn</div>

I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering. I have experience developing programs in various languages since 2018, starting with a website for a large student database for the Faculty of Engineering. The website was developed in PHP using Laravel as the main framework. I also have experience developing websites in other languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript in recent years. I can also use frameworks for developing JavaScript-based websites such as React, as well as mobile applications with React Native. I am currently studying Flutter and have experience distributing apps on both Android and iOS.

For backend systems, I can use NodeJS with NestJS or Express as the main framework for less complex projects. I can also develop with Golang, which is primarily used for RESTful communication between backend and frontend. I can also develop real-time web applications using websockets, SSE, and socket.io. I can write Python for data science projects, including some work related to machine learning and image processing.

I also have experience with Linux servers, from preparing infrastructure to setting up HCI systems, which are popular and can maximize server performance. I can also manage network systems and configure routers for both Cisco and Mikrotik, including security and network traffic monitoring. I currently use Docker as the main method for deploying projects due to its high flexibility.
